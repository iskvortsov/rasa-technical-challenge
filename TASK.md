## Instructions
The purpose of this exercise is to provide you with an opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge, skills, and communication abilities effectively.

For this exercise to be beneficial, solutions should not be available on the internet. Please refrain from distributing these questions in any form.

Once you feel prepared, send us a link to your GitHub repository where this assignment is implemented.

The exercise consists of 3 parts:

- Part 1: Automating the CLI application "https://taskwarrior.org/docs/introduction/".
- Part 2: Automating REST API endpoints from https://fakestoreapi.com/docs#c-single.
- Part 3: Running the tests on CI 

We heavily use pytest for test automation. If you are not comfortable with pytest, you can use an alternate python based test framework.

## Part 1: Automated CLI tests

### Tasks:

1. Download your required distribution from the list https://taskwarrior.org/download/
2. Familiarize yourself with the application with a quick demonstration https://taskwarrior.org/docs/start/ and come up with scenarios to automate. You can find a list of command line syntaxes here : https://taskwarrior.org/docs/syntax/.
3. Write down the scenarios you devised and automate the ones that you find relevant.

## Part 2: Automated API tests

### Tasks:

1. Familiarize yourself with the simple API endpoints listed here : https://fakestoreapi.com/docs#c-single and come up with scenarios to automate from the Cart section. 
2. Write down the scenarios you devised and automate the ones that you find relevant.

## Part 3: CI

1. Run the tests you created on a CI system. (We use GitHub Actions in Rasa. If you are not comfortable with that, please choose a CI system of your choice.)

## Things to consider

1. Ensure that your solution follows engineering best practices. Your repository should be well-organized, tests should be readable, easily maintainable, and scalable.
2. Write a `README.md` file explaining the steps to set up the project locally and run the tests.
3. Although we would like you to complete this task to the best of your ability, we value your time, and thus you are not expected to spend more than 4 hours working on this assignment.
4. Add a `Future Improvements` section to the README listing out improvements you would make to the project if you had more time.
5. Write down all the test scenarios that you devised but not automated. We will discuss them further
